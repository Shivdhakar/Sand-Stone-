    <h2>Natural Split Sandstone Paving</h2>
    <br>
<p>Natural cut calibrated Indian sandstone paving is made in the traditional way by skilled masons using hammer and chisel to split and dress stone slabs out of blocks. Each slab is cleanly split revealing a riven surface which creates an old world look and feel.
