    <h3> A legacy in Sand Stone </h3>

    <br>

<P>Shiv Bholenath Stone started in 2008 and has grown to be India's largest exporter of sandstone.

    We process and export almost 2 million square meters of quartzitic sandstone for hard landscaping to our customers in the UK, USA, Germany, Japan and many other countries.
    
    Our frost resistant Quartzite sandstones have very low porosity and are suitable for use as internal tiles for floors or for use as patios and driveways.
    
    We are headquartered in Bijoliya and have 5 factories spread over 250,000 square meters located in North and South India.</P>
